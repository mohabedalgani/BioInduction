# Bioinformatic Induction:

Description:
The code based on Python Jupyter have released after each task assigned by Dr. Basel Abo Jamous. It includes implementation for preprocessing phases as well as other various tasks (transformation, normalization, clustering, and etc.). The lessons I learned in this repo are incorporated into Uniport LUAD dataset to make my understading bettter about each gene IDs. I highly recommend you to read every line of code and try to memics the functions/methods utilized in your own way. This repo will keep on being updated/modified without further notice.

This repo holds the codes and models for the tasks requested on Magniphai.AI
